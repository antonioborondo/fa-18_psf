### HOTAS (Thrustmaster T.Flight HOTAS X)

Throttle is only available with the 5 axes mode and it is asigned wrongly to the slider 0 axis (rocking button) by default.

To assign the throttle to the Z axis (throttle), first switch to the 5 axes mode.

Then map these axes as follows:
- Rocking left -> Throttle up
- Rocking right -> Throttle down

How to switch between the 4-5 axes mode and how to map buttons/axes is explained in the manual: https://ts.thrustmaster.com/download/accessories/Manuals/TFHX/t-flight_hotas_X_manual.pdf
